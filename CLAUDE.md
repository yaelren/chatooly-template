# Chatooly Tool Builder - Claude Code Instructions

Welcome to the Chatooly Template! This modular instruction system helps Claude Code efficiently build amazing creative tools while following all the essential rules.

## 📁 Modular Rule System

This CLAUDE.md file references focused rule modules to optimize token usage and maintainability:

### Core Rules & Structure
- **[01-core-rules.md](claude-rules/01-core-rules.md)** - MANDATORY development rules (canvas structure, CDN scripts, export containers)
- **[02-workflow-setup.md](claude-rules/02-workflow-setup.md)** - Step-by-step workflow when user says "build a tool"

### Technical Implementation
- **[03-canvas-resize.md](claude-rules/03-canvas-resize.md)** - Canvas resize handling and mouse coordinate mapping
- **[04-high-res-export.md](claude-rules/04-high-res-export.md)** - High-resolution export implementation (mandatory)
- **[05-library-selection.md](claude-rules/05-library-selection.md)** - Library selection guide and setup code
- **[08-background-system.md](claude-rules/08-background-system.md)** - Background controls (wire up HTML to backgroundManager API)

### Design & Publishing
- **[06-design-system.md](claude-rules/06-design-system.md)** - Chatooly CSS variables and styling system
- **[07-publishing-troubleshooting.md](claude-rules/07-publishing-troubleshooting.md)** - Publishing workflow and common issue solutions

## 🚀 Quick Start for Claude Code

When a designer says **"Let's build a tool"** or **"I want to create..."**:

1. **Read Core Rules**: Start with `claude-rules/01-core-rules.md`
2. **Follow Workflow**: Use `claude-rules/02-workflow-setup.md` step-by-step
3. **Reference Technical Files**: Load specific implementation files as needed
4. **Use TodoWrite**: Track all tasks systematically

## 💡 Key Benefits of This System

### For Claude Code:
- **Token Efficiency**: Load only relevant rule sections
- **Focused Context**: Each file covers one specific area
- **Better Maintainability**: Update individual rules without affecting others
- **Reduced Errors**: Clear, focused instructions prevent rule conflicts

### For Designers:
- **Consistent Results**: Claude follows the same systematic approach every time
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All technical requirements handled automatically
- **Easy Updates**: Rule improvements can be made to specific areas

## 🎯 Example Usage Patterns

```
User: "Build a gradient generator"
→ Claude reads: 01-core-rules.md + 02-workflow-setup.md
→ Creates TodoWrite task list
→ Loads: 05-library-selection.md (for Canvas API)
→ Implements tool following core rules
→ References: 04-high-res-export.md for export function
→ Uses: 06-design-system.md for UI styling
```
